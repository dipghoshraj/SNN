# SNN (Simple Neural netowrk)

Simple neural network is my hobby project. This project describe the structure of the neural network and how things does work in the network. The basic structre of the neural network in this project is divided into four types of network.

- Single input single output network (SISO).
- Single input Multiple output network (SIMO).
- Multiple input single output network (MIsO) or basic perceptron
- Multiple input multiple output network (MIMO) or complex perceptron.
